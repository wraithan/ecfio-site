          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            Software development for hobbyist hardware has not progressed nearly as much as the hardware itself has in the last few years.
            Arduino IDE makes it easy for people on any platform to get started and that is valuable, but advanced use cases are harder.
            Currently, to use libraries you find on the internet, you are left copy and pasting them into your project, or putting the files into multiple directories in the IDE's directory.
          </p>

          <p>
            The first aim will be clean up the build system.
            The plan is to leverage <a href="https://github.com/substack/dotc">dotc</a> and <a href="http://inotool.org">ino</a> as a starting point.
            ecfio will wrap these two utilities (and maybe others) to streamline project creation and development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, will be move a few of the core modules from the Arduino IDE into dotc modules.
            They will be tracked in their own repos and able to be updated outside of the IDE.
            The module repos will include documentation for that module, making it a complete unit.
            This will be a test of the dotc system and whether this project is truly feasible.
          </p>

          <p>
            The eventual goal will be to have an ecosystem of modules, built on open source tools, that have documentation and are easily installable.

            This is a work in progress.
          </p>
          <code>ecfio init</code>
          <p>Initializes your project, creating the base directory structure and files.</p>
          <code>ecfio build</code>
          <p>Takes your project, preprocesses it, and then builds the .hex file.</p>
          <code>ecfio push</code>
          <p>Takes the .hex file and pushes it to your device.</p>
